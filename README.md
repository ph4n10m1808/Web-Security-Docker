# Web Project

## Purpose

This project aims to study Docker and pentesting. It will involve setting up a web environment using Docker and exploring various pentesting techniques to assess and improve the security of the application.

## Objectives

- **Learn Docker**: Understand the basics of Docker, including containerization, image creation, and management.
- **Set Up Web Environment**: Use Docker to set up a web environment for testing purposes.
- **Pentesting**: Apply various pentesting techniques to the web environment to identify and address security vulnerabilities.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Docker**: For containerization and environment setup.
- **Pentesting Tools**: Various tools such as Nmap, Metasploit, and others to perform security assessments.

## Steps

1. **Docker Setup**: Install Docker and create a basic web environment.
2. **Environment Configuration**: Configure the web environment to simulate a real-world scenario.
3. **Pentesting**: Perform pentesting on the configured environment, identify vulnerabilities, and document the findings.
4. **Mitigation**: Implement measures to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, you should have a solid understanding of Docker and basic pentesting techniques, along with practical experience in securing a web environment.
